[Spade](https://spade-lang.org) wrappers for the [Berkley Hardfloat](https://github.com/ucb-bar/berkeley-hardfloat) floating-point library, powered by my [custom downstream patches](https://github.com/ethanuppal/berkeley-hardfloat).

## What's in this library?

This library exposes two levels of abstraction over Hardfloat:

### `hardfloat-sys`

`hardfloat-sys` provides raw bindings to the Hardfloat Verilog.
For instance, here's how you would convert a two's complement `uint<32>` to a
IEEE 32-bit floating point `uint<32>` (it was Berkeley's decision to
use camel case, don't @ me):

```rs
entity uint32_to_float32(int_to_convert: uint<32>) -> uint<32> {
    let (recoded_out, recoded_out_inv) = port;
    let (exception_flags, exception_flags_inv) = port;

    // int -> recoded
    inst hardfloat::hardfloat_sys::iNToRecFN::<32, 8, 24>(
        0, // control bit(s)
        true, // whether input is signed 
        int_to_convert, // actual integer value to convert
        0, // rounding mode
        recoded_out_inv,  // output floating point
        exception_flags_inv // errors that occured in conversion
    );

    // recoded 32-bit float is 33 bits
    let recoded_bits: uint<33> = inst ports::read_mut_wire(recoded_out);
    let (float_out, float_out_inv) = port;

    // recoded -> ieee
    inst hardfloat::hardfloat_sys::recFNToFN::<8, 24>(
        *recoded_out, // recoded representation
        float_out // ieee representation
    );

    *float_out
}
```

Let's break down what's going on here, in case you aren't too familiar with
Spade.

We're declaring a new `entity`, which is kind of like a general Verilog module,
that takes in and returns 32-bit unsigned integers.
To do so, we'll use `hardfloat_sys::iNToRecFN`.

- The `input` is to be a two's complement representation of an integer.
- The output is a (presumably big endian) representation of the floating-point number best approximating `input`.

Since `hardfloat-sys` exposes Verilog entities, we're going to have to use
the `port` keyword to construct `inv &` wires (which are kind of like Verilog's
`output` ports).

Hardfloat works with an internal "recoded" representation that is one more bit
than the standard IEEE representation.
We can restore the IEEE representation using `hardfloat_sys::recFNToFN`.

And that's it!
We can test this entity in Rust using [marlin](https://github.com/ethanuppal/marlin):

```python
use marlin::{spade::prelude::*, verilator::VerilatorRuntimeOptions};
use rand::Rng;
use snafu::Whatever;

#[spade(src = "src/hardfloat_sys_test.spade", name = "uint32_to_float32")]
struct UInt32ToFloat32;

#[test]
#[snafu::report]
fn main() -> Result<(), Whatever> {
    colog::init();

    let mut runtime = SpadeRuntime::new(
        SpadeRuntimeOptions {
            verilator_options: VerilatorRuntimeOptions {
                // hardfloat has these warnings
                ignored_warnings: vec!["WIDTHTRUNC".into(), "WIDTHEXPAND".into()],
                ..Default::default()
            },
            ..Default::default()
        },
        true,
    )?;

    let mut uint32_to_float32 = runtime.create_model::<UInt32ToFloat32>()?;

    let mut rng = rand::rng();
    for _ in 0..100 {
        let random_int = rng.random::<u32>();
        let expected = u32::from_ne_bytes((random_int as f32).to_ne_bytes());

        uint32_to_float32.int_to_convert = u32::from_ne_bytes(random_int.to_ne_bytes());
        uint32_to_float32.eval();
        let actual = uint32_to_float32.result;

        assert_eq!(actual, expected, "Casting the integer {} to its nearest floating point representation did not agree with the hardware module", random_int);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

If you run `cargo test`, it will pass!

### `hardfloat`

Currently, only the raw bindings are usable.
With a bit more hacking in Spade's type system, my envisioned API should be able
to work.
However, you can view the beginnings at [`src/main.spade`](./src/main.spade).
